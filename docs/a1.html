      <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!</p>

    <h2>Schematic</h2>
    <div class="assignment-section">
      <img src="a1-schematic.jpeg" width="600" alt="Schematic of 4 LEDs" />
      <p> 
        This schematic shows 4 LEDs (2 red and 2 green) connected to pins 0, 1, 2, and 3. It also shows how I calculated the resistor, which is 220 ohms for each LED.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Circuit</h2>
    <div class="assignment-section">
      <img src="a1-circuit.jpeg" width="600" alt="Photo of breadboard circuit" />
      <p>
        This is the physical implementation of the circuit on the breadboard, LEDs, resistors, and connection to the ground/pins.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Code</h2>
    <div class="assignment-section">
      <p>Below is the code used to control the LEDs.</p>
      <pre><code>
        // 1000 ms timer
        int timer = 1000;

        void setup() {
          // use a for loop to initialize each pin as an output:
          for (int thisPin = 0; thisPin < 4; thisPin++) {
            pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);
          }
        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          // loop from the lowest pin to the highest:
          for (int thisPin = 0; thisPin < 2; thisPin++) {
            // turn pin 0 or 1 on:
            digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);  
            // turn pin 2 or 3on:
            digitalWrite(thisPin + 2, HIGH);  
            // delay next action:
            delay(timer);  
            // turn pin 0 or 1 off:
            digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);
            // turn pin 2 or 3 off:
            digitalWrite(thisPin + 2, LOW);
          }
        }
      </code></pre>

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

    <h3>(1)</h3>
    <img src="a1-voltage.jpeg" width="600" alt="Voltage measurement photo" />
    <p>
      The graph above shows the voltage of my red and green LEDs over times. The red represents the 2 Red LEDs and the green represents the 2 Green LEDs. 
    </p>

    <h3>(2)</h3>
    <p>
      I could blink independently 14 LEDs because it has 14 digital pins from 0 to 13. With each LED drawing 20mA, that would draw 280mA total.
    </p>

    <h3>(3)</h3>
    <p>
      In order to no longer tell the LEDs are blinking, I would need to blink them around 30 to 60 times per second.  
    </p>

    <h3>(4)</h3>
    <p>
      I used Google Gemini to help me format the HTML for this page, as well as to help correctly copy over my code to be displayed easily on the page.
